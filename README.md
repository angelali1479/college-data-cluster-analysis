# Comparing Colleges Based on Various Metrics
## Background
Studies have shown that colleges play a major role in intergenerational income mobility rate. There are many other factors that contribute to the mobility rate (such as parental income and accessibility of the college), but I believe it is also important to focus on specific college variables that may impact mobility rate as well ([Fordham Institute](https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/how-college-affects-upward-mobility)).

## Business Question
How are different colleges grouped based on instructional expenditures per student, median earnings of students 10 years after entry, percentage stem majors, and percentage social science majors? How can we use this data to help colleges improve their mobility rate?
