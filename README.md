# Comparing Colleges Based on Various Metrics
## Background
Studies have shown that colleges play a major role in intergenerational income mobility rate. There are many other factors that contribute to the mobility rate (such as parental income and accessibility of the college), but I believe it is also important to focus on specific college variables that may impact mobility rate as well ([Fordham Institute](https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/how-college-affects-upward-mobility)).

I specifically looked into variables such as instructional expenditures per student, median earnings of students, percentage of certain majors, and mobility rate to see how colleges would be grouped together. This would be useful to see if these clusters and cluster anchors show that certain variables can be grouped together in a way that relates variables together. Then, we can extrapolate the results to see if making changes for specific variables can help improve the mobility rate of colleges.

## Business Question
How are different colleges grouped based on instructional expenditures per student, median earnings of students 10 years after entry, percentage stem majors, and percentage social science majors? How can we use this data to help colleges improve their mobility rate?

## Data Analysis

This table contains the normalized values of the 5 variables used in the cluster analysis.
**Cluster 1:**
Compared to the other clusters, cluster 1 has the largest amount of standard deviations above the average for percentage stem major. Both instructional expenditures per student and median earnings of students 10 years after entry were only slightly above average while the mobility rate was the closest to average out of all the clusters. Cluster 1's only variable with a below average standard deviation is percentage social science.
